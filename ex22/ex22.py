# You know all that syntax man
# Go on.
# some memorizations about work with files:
# open(filename, "w") 
# f.write("meow")
# f.seek(0) (you can send f as argument to func and f.seek(0) will affect the external f)
# f.read() puts seek position to the EOF
# you have to close files, but if you do not assign file object to some variable, it will be closed automatically
# script, first, second, third = argv - that's the way you unpacking the list, script = argv[0], first = argv[1] and so on 0, 1, 2...len(argv) - 1
# if you put *args into the function definition parameter, it means you can send arbitrary amout of arguments to it, and they
# will be inside the args list. It's like argv, but for the functions, not the whole script
# use formatted strings
# you gonna handle it all man, go on.
# exists() func from os.path tells you if there is that file in the working directory
# like in C, every if func return a value, you can play with it like this func1(func2())
# you can use ; character to separate instructions
# f"titi" formatted string also just return a string, so you can use it.
# inside the """ you can format text freely, as in editor in will be seen in the shell
# str.format(varibale) formats string
# That's all. Move on. That's everything interesting you found out. Don't waste time, move on.
# Here is EVERYTHING you found out, you checked it a few times already. Move on.
# That's the fact. After you can look up this file. Move on.
# These exercises are still with you, and you always can look up, and in book there will be enhardments of the knowledge. Move on.
